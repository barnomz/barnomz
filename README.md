# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.

## Export/Import Schedules

- Export: On the schedules page, use the JSON export button near the bottom-left action buttons. It always exports all schedules to a `.json` file containing `schedules` and `currentScheduleId`.
- Import: Use the JSON import button, pick a valid `.json` file, then choose to “Append to existing” or “Replace all”. The app validates structure and enforces the maximum number of schedules.
